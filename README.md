[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/aptible/joecool.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/aptible/joecool)

A Docker image that forwards logs from a set of Docker containers to
[Gentleman Jerry](https://github.com/aptible/gentlemanjerry).

Joe Cool is implemented as a wrapper around a [filebeat](https://github.com/elastic/beats/tree/master/filebeat)
instance that tracks logs (any stdout/stderr) from a set of Docker containers. Docker container logs are
read by mounting `/var/lib/docker/containers` inside the Joe Cool container. Joe Cool uses a modified
filebeat that includes some Docker-specific improvements and bug fixes.

[Aptible](https://www.aptible.com)'s platform uses Joe Cools to forward logs from each set of containers
corresponding to a particular service. For example, an application consisting of 2 web processes and
1 worker process would have 2 Joe Cools forwarding logs, one watching both web processes and one watching
the worker process.

## Example

To see Joe Cool in action, first follow the
[instructions for building and running Gentleman Jerry](https://github.com/aptible/gentlemanjerry#example)
so that Joe Cool has somebody to pass the logs to. Following those instructions, you should have a
Gentleman Jerry endpoint and a certificate file. We'll use `gentlemanjerry:1234` for the endpoint and
`/tmp/jerry-cert/jerry.crt` for the certificate file name in the instructions that follow.

If you don't already have a running container that you'd like to attach logging to, start a bash shell
in a separate container running using `docker run -i -t quay.io/aptible/ubuntu:14.04`. We'll need a
prefix of the docker id of this container to monitor it. We use `deadbeef` for this prefix below. After
we set up Joe Cool and Gentleman Jerry to watch this container, anything you type in the bash shell will
get logged.

Next, pull the image from quay (`docker pull quay.io/aptible/joecool`) or build it locally
(`make build`). The image name will be `quay.io/aptible/joecool:latest` if you pull or build
from the `master` branch.

Finally, run the `run-joe-cool.sh` script in a container created from the resulting image:

```
$ docker run -i -t \
>   -e "LOGSTASH_ENDPOINT=gentlemanjerry:1234" \
>   -e "LOGSTASH_CERTIFICATE=`cat /tmp/jerry-cert/jerry.crt`" \
>   -e "CONTAINERS="[\"deadbeef\"]" \
>   -v /var/lib/docker/containers:/tmp/dockerlogs:ro \
>   quay.io/aptible/joecool:latest
```

You should now see any output in the `deadbeef` container picked up by Joe Cool and sent to Gentleman
Jerry.

## Environment variables

Runtime behavior of Joe Cool can be modified by passing the following environment variables to
`docker run`:

* `LOGSTASH_ENDPOINT`: Required. The endpoint where Gentleman Jerry is running.
* `LOGSTASH_CERTIFICATE`: Required. Gentleman Jerry's certificate.
* `CONTAINERS`: Required. A JSON-formatted list of docker container id prefixes. Specifies
   which containers Joe Cool will monitor for logs.
* `SERVICE_NAME`: Optional. Corresponds to the "service" field reported to Gentleman Jerry.
* `READ_FROM_BEGINNING`: Optional. If this variable is set, the entire contents of log files will be
   forwarded. The default behavior is to only tail the log files.

## Tests

All tests are implemented in bats. Run them with:

    make build
